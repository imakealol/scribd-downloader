## Features

- **One-click download** - Just paste the Scribd URL and get your PDF
- **Supports both Scribd URL styles** - Works with `/document/...` and legacy `/doc/...` links
- **Runs in background** - Headless Chrome, no browser window pops up
- **No scrolling required** - Loads Scribd page data directly instead of simulating page-by-page scrolling
- **Clean PDFs** - No cookie banners, toolbars, or watermarks
- **Bounded-memory export** - Keeps only a configurable batch of fully loaded pages in Chrome at once
- **Disk-spooled merge** - Writes each rendered page to temporary storage before combining the final PDF with `pypdf`
- **Large document support** - Verified with image-heavy documents containing up to 2,552 pages
- **Better math rendering** - Preserves Scribd layout classes needed by equations and SVG content
- **Exact pagination** - Validates that every Scribd page produces exactly one PDF sheet
- **Dynamic page size** - Detects each rendered page's dimensions instead of forcing one fixed sheet size
- **Auto filename** - PDF named after the document URL automatically
- **No login required** - Works without Scribd account

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Google Chrome browser installed
- Chrome WebDriver (auto-managed by Selenium)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fullstackusama/scribd-downloader.git
   cd scribd-downloader
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Run the script**
   ```bash
   python scribd-downloader.py
   ```

2. **Paste the Scribd document URL** when prompted:
   ```
   Input link Scribd: https://www.scribd.com/document/123456789/Document-Title
   ```

   Legacy Scribd URLs also work:
   ```
   Input link Scribd: https://www.scribd.com/doc/123456789/Document-Title
   ```

3. **Wait for the download** - The script will:
   - Open the document in headless Chrome
   - Load document pages directly in bounded batches
   - Release each batch from Chrome after printing to control memory use
   - Remove unwanted elements (toolbars, cookie banners)
   - Spool individual pages to temporary storage and merge the final PDF
   - Save the PDF in the current directory

4. **Done!** Your PDF will be saved with the document name from the URL.

## How It Works

1. **URL Conversion** - Converts Scribd document URL to embeddable format
2. **Headless Browser** - Opens Chrome in background (invisible)
3. **Batched Page Loading** - Loads a small group of Scribd pages and their images directly without scrolling
4. **Cleanup** - Removes toolbars, cookie banners, and overlays while preserving Scribd layout classes
5. **Per-page Export** - Detects each page's rendered size and prints exactly one PDF sheet through Chrome DevTools Protocol
6. **Memory Release** - Removes the completed batch from Chrome and requests garbage collection
7. **Disk-spooled Merge** - Combines the temporary one-page PDFs into the final document with `pypdf`
8. **Auto Close** - Browser closes automatically after saving

## Benchmarks

Reference results from one Windows machine are shown below. Performance varies with network speed, document complexity, CPU, RAM, Chrome version, and storage speed.

| Document | Pages | Total Time | Output Size | Blank Pages | Peak Combined RAM |
|----------|------:|-----------:|------------:|------------:|------------------:|
| CSS Solved Past Papers | 359 | 58.36 seconds | 228.49 MB | 0 | 1.47 GB |
| Manual de Servicio MX-305 | 2,552 | 14 minutes 12 seconds | 237.28 MB | 0 | 2.46 GB |

The batch size was `8` in both tests. Long documents still take time because Chrome must print every page individually, but fully loaded browser content is kept to one batch at a time.

## Troubleshooting

### "ChromeDriver not found" error
The script uses Selenium Manager to auto-download ChromeDriver. If you face issues:
```bash
pip install --upgrade selenium
```

### PDF not saving
- Ensure you have write permissions in the current directory
- Check if the Scribd URL is valid and accessible
- For very large documents, increase `SCRIBD_CDP_TIMEOUT` (default: `600`)

### Blank pages in PDF
- Some documents may have DRM protection
- Try increasing `SCRIBD_PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT` if page images load slowly
- If a document still renders incorrectly, try visible mode with `SCRIBD_HEADLESS=0`

### Very large documents
- Ensure the drive containing your temporary directory has enough free space for individual page PDFs
- Reduce `SCRIBD_EXPORT_BATCH_SIZE` if Chrome uses too much memory
- Increase `SCRIBD_PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT` when slow image assets time out
- Long documents still take time because each page is printed and validated separately

### Large, image-heavy, or math-heavy documents
You can tune the export with environment variables:

```powershell
$env:SCRIBD_CDP_TIMEOUT="900"
$env:SCRIBD_PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT="180"
$env:SCRIBD_EXPORT_BATCH_SIZE="4"
python scribd-downloader.py
```

Useful variables:

- `SCRIBD_CDP_TIMEOUT` - ChromeDriver command timeout in seconds for `Page.printToPDF`
- `SCRIBD_PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT` - Maximum direct page-loading time in seconds (default: `120`)
- `SCRIBD_EXPORT_BATCH_SIZE` - Maximum fully loaded pages kept in Chrome at once (default: `8`)
- `SCRIBD_HEADLESS=0` - Run with a visible browser when debugging rendering issues locally
